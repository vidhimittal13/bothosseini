# @BotHosseini
Twitter bot that tweets quotes from Khaled Hosseini's novels to remind us of the power of storytelling and the resilience of human spirit. Tweeting every 2 hours.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Twitter API
- Tweepy
- Langdetect (for language detection)

## Project Description

This bot was developed as a result of my passion for tech and a keen interest in literature. It works by scraping quotes from the author's Goodreads page. It uses langdetect to ensure only English quotes are posted. It is programmed to tweet a quote every two hours, generating an engaging and consistent stream of literary content.

## Future Work

1. Implement sentiment analysis to classify and post positive quotes.
2. Expand the bot's functionality to include quotes from other authors.
3. Add a feature to interact with followers of the Twitter account.
